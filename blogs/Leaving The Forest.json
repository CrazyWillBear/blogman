Chastain\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the crossroads  \n\nwhen I came to them,  \n\nI was lost.  \n\n\n\n<br />\n\n\n\nShould I have asked  \n\nfor directions?  \n\n\n\n<br />\n\n\n\nMaybe.  \n\nDid I?  \n\nOften, no.  \n\n\n\n<br />\n\n\n\nI left the pressed gravel  \n\nand wandered into the forest,  \n\nAmong flower and beast.  \n\n\n\n<br />\n\n\n\nI met a few,  \n\nBlackberries got me through  \n\nthe winter.  \n\n\n\n<br />\n\n\n\nMy campsite was cozy.  \n\nI fed the birds  \n\nand took to them.  \n\n\n\n<br />\n\n\n\nMen came,  \n\nwith chainsaws and rifles  \n\nto tear down the forest. \n\n\n\n<br />\n\n\n\nI had to leave.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to,  \n\nI had slain my first elk,  \n\nI craved its flesh.  \n\n\n\n<br />\n\n\n\nI found my way  \n\nto the highway.  \n\n\n\n<br />\n\n\n\nEveryone is in their cars,  \n\nspeeding by.  \n\nI am barefoot and  \n\nI walk slow.\n", "tags": ["poetry"], "date_created": "2025-04-04T00:10:50.954975", "date_last_modified": "2025-04-04T00:25:33.124514"}
