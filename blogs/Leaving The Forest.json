Chastain\n\n\nAt the crossroads  \nwhen I came to them,  \nI was lost.  \n\n<br />\n\nShould I have asked  \nfor directions?  \n\n<br />\n\nMaybe.  \nDid I?  \nOften, no.  \n\n<br />\n\nI left the pressed gravel  \nand wandered into the forest,  \nAmong flower and beast.  \n\n<br />\n\nI met a few,  \nBlackberries got me through  \nthe winter.  \n\n<br />\n\nMy campsite was cozy.  \nI fed the birds  \nand took to them.  \n\n<br />\n\nMen came,  \nwith chainsaws and rifles  \nto tear down the forest. \n\n<br />\n\nI had to leave.  \nI didn\u2019t want to,  \nI had slain my first elk,  \nI craved its flesh.  \n\n<br />\n\nI found my way  \nto the highway.  \n\n<br />\n\nEveryone is in their cars,  \nspeeding by.  \nI am barefoot and  \nI walk slow.\n", "tags": ["poetry"], "date_created": "2025-02-19T00:10:50.954975", "date_last_modified": "2025-02-19T00:10:50.954975"}
