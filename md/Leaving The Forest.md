# Leaving The Forest

#### By William B. Chastain

<hr>

At the crossroads

when I came to them,

I was lost.

<br />

Should I have asked

for directions?

<br />

Maybe.

Did I?

Often, no.

<br />

I left the pressed gravel

and wandered into the forest,

Among flower and beast.

<br />

I met a few,

Blackberries got me through

the winter.

<br />

My campsite was cozy.

I fed the birds

and took to them.

<br />

Men came,

with chainsaws and rifles

to tear down the forest.

<br />

I had to leave.

I didnâ€™t want to,

I had slain my first elk,

I craved its flesh.

<br />

I found my way

to the highway.

<br />

Everyone is in their cars,

speeding by.

I am barefoot and

I walk slow.
